1. First download the program files as a zip file and then extract them to your desired location
2. Open a terminal inside of the folder which includes the files
3. Run the 'npm install' command to install the necessary modules from the package.json file
4. After installing the modules, the server can be started with the command 'node server.js'
5. Open another terminal and run the client application with the command 'node client.js 127.0.0.1 3000', which will connect it to the server
